    # Enter an email and password. Account is created. "Verification
    # email has been sent to $email" is shown. User redirected to login page.

    # If the account already existed, they'll more than likely have the
    # wrong password when they try to login - at that point the legit
    # user with that email will have received something like "We
    # received a request for a new account with this email. You already
    # have an account so the new account was NOT created. If you have
    # forgotten your password, you can <reset it>."

    # If the account didn't exist, the email says "We received a request

    # know the password and it'll allow them to confirm that they know what
    # it is (and maybe auto-store in password manager)
    # If it was an attempt to create a duplicate, then chances are they
    # won't know the password and will then get the option to recover the
    # password through the normal route.
